# Assignment Problem

A special class of transportation problem is called assignment problem in which

1. supply i = demand j = 1, squared matrix
2. each decision variable is a binary decision variable (0, 1)
3. all the constraints are in form of equations (with "=" signs)

## Example

In a construction site, there are 4 cranes. Each crane must be allocated to one job. The time required to set up each crane for each job is shown in the table. Find the best assignment of cranes to the jobs so the total time required for completing the jobs is minimized.

|  | Job1 | Job2 | Job3 | Job4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Crane1 | 16 | 2 | 3 | 7 |
| Crane2 | 5 | 13 | 7 | 5 |
| Crane3 | 8 | 6 | 5 | 9 |
| Crane4 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 11 |
